    <div class="bio">
        I am a self-taught developer with a good grasp on the fundamentals of computer science. I have used low level languages such as Rust for making desktop applications and emulators and C for bare metal applications without the use of any HAL libraries. My strongest languages are Rust and JavaScript, but I have used TypeScript, C, C#, Java and Python. I am able to pick up languages fairly quickly. 

        I am highly self-motivated, dedicated and have a deep thirst for knowledge. I love writing clean code that is tested, robust and reusable. I am hugely passionate about programming and am very excited to make the career switch into something I love doing. I currently run my own welding company but after 6 years of business, I am looking to change my career into something that will challenge me, allow me to put my creative problem-solving skills to use and allow me to keep learning and refining my skills.

            <h2>Blackjack Game - Rust</h2>
            <p>
                The project that taught me a lot about OOP was a desktop game written in Rust, using SDL2 for the rendering. This project was a good way for me to learn about how to properly structure a project and make sure it is scalable. I implemented an OOP structure and TDD to build a modular, loosely coupled, codebase. I was able to reuse code for the computer AI and the rendering to make it easy to scale.

                A website I built for my current business using React and deploying on AWS to utilise the Ci/CD pipeline AWS provides. It's a single page website, built for mobile and desktop, with a functioning message form. The message form is built with EmailJs to avoid building any backend for such a simple website.

                For the last 6 years I have been running my own business installing pipework in various industries. As this is a small company, I carry out all of the roles that a business requires. I meet with the customer to discuss what the requirements are and how I can help them achieve it. This is then followed by the rest of the cycle of planning, executing, monitoring and closing.

                I was an apprentice at Prodrive for 2 years before being offered a full time job on completion. I spent the first year learning how to weld and fabricate, in the second year I had the opportunity to work on some brand-new projects where I had to learn how to use my fabrication skills to overcome problems.
